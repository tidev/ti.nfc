name: Modules.Nfc.NfcAdapter
summary: Represents the local NFC adapter.
description: |
    The NFC adapter gives you access to the features of the NFC device. The NFC adapter proxy is always
    associated with the activity that was the current activity when it was created. The NFC Adapter must
    be created after the activity has been opened. You can use the window `open` event to know when the
    activity has been opened.

    Use the <Modules.Nfc.createNfcAdapter> method to create an NFC adapter.

  - name: onNewIntent
    since: "1.0.0"  
    platforms: [android]
    summary: Processes a new intent received by an application.
    description: |
        The NFC tag dispatch system will dispatch an intent to your application when it discovers a tag
        that matches your application's intent filters. Intents received by your application after it has
        started MUST be passed to this method in order to be processed and parsed for processing by your
        application. If the intent is recognized as an NFC action, this method will call your
        `onNdefDiscovered`, `onTagDiscovered`, or `onTechDiscovered' callback with the parsed information.
        You should add an event listener to the current activity for the `newintent` event in your application 
        and call this method with the received intent.
    parameters:
      - name: intent
        summary: The Android intent received by your application
        type: Titanium.Android.Intent
    platforms: [android]

  - name: disableForegroundDispatch

    platforms: [android]

  - name: disableForegroundNdefPush

    platforms: [android]   
    summary: Disable NDEF message push over P2P.

        This method was deprecated in API level 14. Use `setNdefPushMessage` instead.
    platforms: [android]

  - name: enableForegroundDispatch
    since: "1.0.0"
    platforms: [android]   
    summary: Enable foreground dispatch to the current activity.
    description: |
        The foreground dispatch system allows an activity to intercept an intent and claim priority over other activities that handle the same intent.
        When using foreground dispatching, you must process the `pause` and `resume` events on the activity. See the `Foreground Dispatch` example
        for an example of enabling and disabling foreground dispatch during these events.

examples:
  - title: Foreground Dispatch (Android)
    example: |
        This example uses foreground dispatch to receive NDEF messages only when the application is in the foreground.

        ``` javascript
        // Create the NFC adapter to be associated with this activity. 
        // There should only be ONE adapter created per activity.
        nfcAdapter = nfc.createNfcAdapter({
            onNdefDiscovered: handleDiscovery,
            onTagDiscovered: handleDiscovery,
            onTechDiscovered: handleDiscovery
        });

        // It's possible that the device does not support NFC. Check it here
        // before we go any further.
        if (!nfcAdapter.isEnabled()) {
            alert('NFC is not enabled on this device');
            return;
        }

        // All tag scans are received by the activity as a new intent. Each
        // scan intent needs to be passed to the nfc adapter for processing.
        var act = Ti.Android.currentActivity;
        act.addEventListener('newintent', function(e) {
            nfcAdapter.onNewIntent(e.intent);
        });

        // To enable NFC dispatching only while the application is in the foreground,
        // the application must signal the module whenever the application state changes.
        act.addEventListener('resume', function(e) {
            nfcAdapter.enableForegroundDispatch(dispatchFilter);
        });
        act.addEventListener('pause', function(e) {
            nfcAdapter.disableForegroundDispatch();
        });

        // This application is only interested in receiving NFC messages while
        // in the foreground. So the dispatch filter must be defined to identify
        // what types of NFC messages to receive.
        dispatchFilter = nfc.createNfcForegroundDispatchFilter({
            intentFilters: [
                { action: nfc.ACTION_NDEF_DISCOVERED, mimeType: 'text/plain' },
                { action: nfc.ACTION_NDEF_DISCOVERED, scheme: 'http', host: 'www.appcelerator.com' }
            ],
            techLists: [
                [ "android.nfc.tech.NfcF" ],
                [ "android.nfc.tech.Ndef" ],

                [ "android.nfc.tech.NfcA" ]
            ]
        });
        ```

  - title: Push Message (Android)
    example: |
        This example sets a default push message to send using Android Beam.

        ``` javascript
        // Create the NFC adapter to be associated with this activity. 
        // There should only be ONE adapter created per activity.
        nfcAdapter = nfc.createNfcAdapter({});

        // It's possible that the device does not support NFC. Check it here
        // before we go any further.
        if (!nfcAdapter.isNdefPushEnabled()) {
            alert('NFC is not enabled on this device');
            return;
        }

        // Set the default Ndef message to send when tapped
        var textRecord = nfc.createNdefRecordText({
            text: "NDEF Push Sample"
        });
        var msg = nfc.createNdefMessage({
            records: [ textRecord ]
        });
        nfcAdapter.setNdefPushMessage(msg);
        ```

  - title: Push Message Callback (Android)
    example: |
        This example uses the push message callback to dynamically create the NDEF message as needed.

        ``` javascript
        // Create the NFC adapter to be associated with this activity. 
        // There should only be ONE adapter created per activity.
        nfcAdapter = nfc.createNfcAdapter({
            onPushMessage: function() {
                if (sendText) {
                    ndefRecord = nfc.createNdefRecordText({
                        text: "Hello"
                    });
                } else {
                    ndefRecord = nfc.createNdefRecordUri({
                        uri: "http://www.appcelerator.com"
                    });
                }
                return nfc.createNdefMessage({
                    records: [
                        ndefRecord 
                    ]
                });
            }
        });

        // It's possible that the device does not support NFC. Check it here
        // before we go any further.
        if (!nfcAdapter.isEnabled()) {
            alert('NFC is not enabled on this device');
            return;
        }
        ```
